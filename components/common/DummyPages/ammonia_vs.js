        <div class="ammonia-title-2">
          When trying to understand the difference between ammonia-based hair color and ammonia-free
          hair color, it's important to understand why ammonia is there in the first place.
        </div>
        <div class="ammonia-title-3">
          The first and most important thing is that Ammonia is used in permanent hair color!
        </div>
        <div class="ammonia-text">
          Ammonia is an alkaline chemical which causes the PH of our hair to rise while it is being
          colored. This allows for the color to lift the cuticle (think of the cuticle like a shell
          that protects the rest of your hair strand) and deposit your hair color into the hair's
          cortex (the cortex is where hair's pigment is found). Without the ammonia, the color would
          not be able to deposit the pigment deep enough into the hair strand for it to last. The
          color would instead lay on the outside of the hair's cuticle where it would soon rinse off
          and therefore it would not be permanent.

        <div class="ammonia-title-1">IF IT'S NOT AMMONIA THAN WHAT IT IS?</div>
        <div class="ammonia-title-2 max-w-504">
          This is where things get a bit tricky! There are two types of ammonia - free color.
        </div>

        <div class="ammonia-text max-w-504">
          The first one is semi or demi permanent hair color which uses a low developer or no
          developer at all to deposit hair color. This type of color does not penetrate your hair
          strand and cannot lighten your hair. Instead it lays on the outside of the hair and rinses
          out gradually.
        </div>
        <div class="ammonia-text max-w-504">
          <strong>There is also permanent ammonia-free hair color.</strong> Keep in mind,
          ammonia-free does not mean chemical-free or all natural. This hair color still needs an
          alkalizing chemical to be able to permanently color your hair. So instead of using
          ammonia, it uses chemicals that work very similarly to ammonia, monoethanolamine (MEA) or
          aminomethylpropanol (AMP). These chemicals also lift the cuticle and deposit color into
          the hair's cortex.

        <div class="ammonia-title-1">NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK;</div>
        <div class="ammonia-title-2">Let's look at the Pros & Cons</div>

        <div class="ammonia-text">
          We'll start with ammonia-based hair color. Ammonia-based hair color has been used for
          years and most likely started getting a bad rap because of its strong smell. However,
          ammonia-based hair color has been proven very safe and there is no research to suggest it
          causes cancers or hormone disruption.
        </div>
        <div class="ammonia-text">
          Ammonia is a smaller molecule which makes it very effective and efficient (also what
          causes the strong smell). Ammonia gives solid results especially for things such as gray
          coverage and vibrant or long-lasting color. Also because of the smaller molecule it rinses
          out of the hair quicker which prevents damage and keeps hair healthier.
        </div>
        <div class="ammonia-text">
          Some people do have a sensitivity to ammonia and in that case an ammonia-based hair color
          would not be a good choice. It's always recommended to do a patch test before using any
          kind of hair color to make sure you won't have a reaction!

      <div class="d-text-5a m-b-50">
        <div class="ammonia-title-1">Now for the ammonia- free color.</div>
        <div class="ammonia-title-2 max-w-504">
          Ammonia- free makes it sound like a safer alternative to traditional permanent
          ammonia-based color but because MEA and AMP are a newer addition to hair color there is
          not as much research on their long-term effects.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="d-right-ammonia">
      <div class="d-text-5b m-b-50">
        <div class="ammonia-text">
          MEA and AMP are a larger molecule and although they color hair in much the same way, it
          has been noted that because of this they don't cover grays as effectively or have the same
          staying power as ammonia based. A benefit of the larger molecule is that it has a much
          milder smell.
        </div>
        <div class="ammonia-text">
          MEA and AMP do give a great option for people who have a sensitivity to ammonia. It should
          also be said that demi and semi-permanent hair color options should be your go-to if you
          do not want to cover grays or go lighter (i.e. you want to stay the same color or go
          darker). This will be your most gentle option as it does not permanently color your hair.
