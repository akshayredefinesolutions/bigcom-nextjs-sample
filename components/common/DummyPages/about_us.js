                <div class="about-team-datail">
                <p>Founded in 1997, Sleekshop.com was started by Andrew Ngo when he was just a junior in high school. As an avid and self-taught technology guru (from graphic design to building computers and everything in between), Andrew always had a natural ambition for achievement and innovation. His entrepreneurial spirit was nurtured at a very young age in his mother's salon where she worked as a nail technician and hairstylist. At the salon, Andrew was able to spend a lot of time watching and learning how to grow a business. By age 15, he was managing all aspects of the salon including inventory, sales and customer service. Discovering the gap in access to high quality beauty products for everyday consumers, Andrew quickly sought to make all exclusive leading brands available to the world at the best prices possible.</p>
                <p>Merging his passion for the internet with his extensive knowledge in the beauty industry, Andrew launched Sleekshop in the humble environment of his garage. While pursuing a Bachelor's of Economics at UC Irvine, Andrew steadily grew Sleekshop's volume from one order a month to several requests day. Despite various hurdles of juggling school and the increasing demands of a small business, Andrew pressed on with confidence that his vision would someday become a reality.</p>
